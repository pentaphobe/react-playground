Actions (dear Diary...):

- `yarn init`
- `yarn add webpack webpack-dev-server path --dev`
- `yarn add babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react --dev`
- created `.babelrc` and `webpack.config.js`
- `yarn add html-webpack-plugin --dev`
- added "start" script to `package.json`
- `yarn add react react-dom`
- quick review to set up path resolving in webpack (so components can be separate to client and/or storybook)
- added `Section.jsx` to test path resolution (works! üçª)
    + can do `import Section from 'components/Section'` now, instead of `import Section from '../components/Section.jsx'`
- `yarn add babel-preset-react-hmre --dev`
- `yarn add react-hot-loader@next --dev`
- Errors abound.  Removed `--hot` from the `webpack-dev-server` script in `package.json`
    + presence of this option _and_ `hot:true` in `webpack.config.js` results in the module name string being doubled up.   Genius.
- Oh dear.  Seem to have gotten HMR working, modules are reloading without the page reloading
    + **BUT** they aren't actually changing.  Suspect this is to do with my path resolving tricks
- Fixed HMR code in index.js per Pat's recommendation, and added rudimentary timer to confirm updates were leaving state intact.
